# Pest Testing Library Example 

## introduction 

PEST is a PHP testing framework that provides a simple way to write tests for your PHP code. It is designed to be easy to use, fast, and flexible, so you can quickly write tests and get fast feedback on the state of your code.

PEST tests are written in PHP and use a fluent interface to make it easy to write tests. The framework provides a number of built-in assertions that you can use to test your code's behavior. For example, you can test whether a function returns the expected result, whether an exception is thrown under certain conditions, or whether two values are equal.

PEST also provides a number of additional features to make testing easier, such as test suites, data providers, and the ability to run tests in parallel.

To get started with PEST, you will need to install the library using composer. Once you have installed PEST, you can write your first test by creating a new PHP file and using the TestSuite class to write your tests.

Here's a simple example of how you can use PEST to test a PHP function:

``` 
use Pest\TestSuite;

TestSuite::test("test function returns expected value", function () {
    $result = your_function_to_test();
    expect($result)->toBe("expected value");
});

```
